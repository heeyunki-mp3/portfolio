In a standard election, selecting a winner is trivial: simply pick the candidate with the majority of votes. However, as the number of candidates increases and different voting rules are used, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine the outcome. More specifically, dealing with incompleteness and uncertainty, an inherent characteristic of polling is a serious challenge confronted in this field of research. While initial computational social choice researchers focused on formulating algorithms to determine winners given partial preferences, currently work is being done to carry this forward to implement and optimize such algorithms. Despite the importance of the problem, there is no comprehensive, public dataset of partial preferences of real-world elections. To address this, we mine datasets of recommender systems and rating websites to develop a comprehensive dataset of partial preferences, where each voter (e.g., viewers on Netflix) gives their preferences over a subset of candidates (e.g., movies on Netflix). We plan to use this dataset to validate our optimizations of the algorithms we are developing, and to eventually make this dataset public."}]},
